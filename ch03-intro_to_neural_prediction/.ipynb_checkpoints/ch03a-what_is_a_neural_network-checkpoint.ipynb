    "### What is a prediction?\n",
    "A prediction is what the neural network tells us given our input data such as \"given the temperature, it is 0% likely that people will wear sweatsuits today\" or \"given a baseball player's batting average, he is 30% likely to hit a home run\" or \"given yesterday's stock price, today's stock price will be 101.52\".\n",

    "### Is this prediction always right?\n",

    "\n",
    "### How does the network learn?\n",
    "Trial and error! First, it tries to make a prediction. Then, it sees whether it was too high or too low. Finally, it changes the weight (up or down) to predict more accurately the next time it sees the same input.\n"

    "A neural network only knows what you feed it as input. It forgets everything else. Later, we will learn how to give neural networks \"short term memories\" by feeding in multiple inputs at once.\n",

    "Another way to think about a neural network's <font color=red> weight is as a measure of sensitivity between the input of the network and its prediction</font>...This sensitivity is very akin to volume. \"Turning up the weight\" amplifies our prediction relative to our input. weight is a volume knob!\n",
